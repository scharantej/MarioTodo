**Assistant:** I understand you want to use Python Flask for a TODO list application where users can log in and sign up using Google. You've also included an unrelated task of playing Mario. I'll focus on designing the TODO list part using Flask.

## HTML Files
- **login.html**: The login page with form fields for email, password, and a "Login with Google" button.
- **signup.html**: The signup page with form fields for first name, last name, email, password, and a "Google Sign up" button.
- **todo_list.html**: The main TODO list page with a form field for adding new items, a list of current items, and buttons for editing and deleting items.

## Routes
- **@app.route('/login')**: Handles the login form submission, validates the input, and redirects to the TODO list page or displays an error message.
- **@app.route('/signup')**: Handles the signup form submission, validates the input, creates a new user, and redirects to the TODO list page or displays an error message.
- **@app.route('/todo', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Handles GET and POST requests. The GET request displays the TODO list, and the POST request adds a new item.
- **@app.route('/edit_todo/<int:todo_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Handles GET and POST requests for editing a specific TODO item. The GET request displays the edit form, and the POST request saves the changes.
- **@app.route('/delete_todo/<int:todo_id>')**: Handles the deletion of a specific TODO item.

**Additional Considerations:**
- The application will use Flask-GoogleAuth for Google login and signup functionality.
- The TODO items will be stored in a database, and you'll need to define models and use Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations.
- User authentication and authorization can be implemented using Flask-Login.
